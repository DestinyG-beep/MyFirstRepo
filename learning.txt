What I have learned from this course
Version control is a system that tracks changes to files so you can review history, undo mistakes, and collaborate safely; Git is a popular distributed version control tool that stores snapshots of your project and uses simple commands like git init, git add, git commit, and git push to record and share changes. Many developers use Git on Linux because the terminal shell makes it easy to run commands, edit files, and script workflows; learning basic Linux commands (like cd, ls, and mkdir) alongside Git helps you manage projects efficiently and confidently as you start coding.
